**THE SELECT STATEMENT:**
--------------------------

  - The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. It's the most commonly used SQL command and follows this basic syntax:
  
  ``` sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
   SELECT: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve. <br>
   FROM: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. <br>
   WHERE: Optional; filters the rows returned based on specified conditions. <br>
  
 ``` sql 
 SELECT name, age FROM employees;
 ```

This will return only the "name" and "age" columns for all rows in the "employees" table. 

**ORDER BY Clause:**
---------------------
- The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set returned by a SQL query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. By default, the sorting is done in ascending order. You can specify the   column(s) by which you want to sort, and optionally specify the direction of sorting (ascending or descending) using the ASC or DESC keywords respectively.
- _Example :_ Consider a table named students with columns id, name, and age. If you want to retrieve the names of students sorted alphabetically in ascending order, you can use the ORDER BY clause as follows:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM students
ORDER BY name ASC;
```
- _Example Query:_
Now, let's combine the SELECT statement, WHERE clause, and ORDER BY clause into a single example query:
Suppose you want to retrieve the names and ages of students who are older than 20 years, sorted by their ages in descending order. You can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM students
WHERE age > 20
ORDER BY age DESC;
```
This query will first filter the rows from the students table where the age is greater than 20, then it will retrieve the names and ages of those students, and finally, it will sort the result set based on the age column in descending order.
