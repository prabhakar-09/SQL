THE SELECT STATEMENT: 

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. It's the most commonly used SQL command and follows this basic syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SELECT: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
FROM: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
WHERE: Optional; filters the rows returned based on specified conditions.

SELECT name, age FROM employees;

This will return only the "name" and "age" columns for all rows in the "employees" table.
